# Creativity

Here are some resources on Creativity with a special emphasis on contributions from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). 
I'll keep adding some stuff here as I collect some suggestions from friends. Most of the things here are from other people and I haven't seen them myself. 
Feel free to send an PR or email me at <cperez3@crimson.ua.edu> for new stuff.

* Abstract: The Art of Design (Netflix) - see the Neri Oxman episode.. From various art fields.. Everything’s pretty good. Haven’t watched this myself but I got this from my Tita Lisa. 
* Chef’s Table - “it’s not really a cooking show as it is about 50 top chiefs and how they got to be where they are now. I love that a lot of them  drew from their roots, went back to them and have found ways to bring them into the present... “ You might want to start with the episodes on Albert Adria and mashama bailey

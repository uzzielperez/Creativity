# Creativity

Here are some resources on Creativity with a special emphasis on contributions from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). 
I'll keep adding some stuff here as I collect some suggestions from friends. Most of the things here are from other people and I haven't seen them myself. 
Feel free to send an PR or email me at <cperez3@crimson.ua.edu> for new stuff. 

## Documentaries

* [The Genius of Einstein: The Science, His Brain, the Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPPnrDdNoUU)
* [The Creative Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gSmcL1CJMQ) 
* Abstract: The Art of Design (Netflix) - see the Neri Oxman episode.. From various art fields.. Everything‚Äôs pretty good. Haven‚Äôt watched this myself but I got this from my Tita Lisa. 
* Chef‚Äôs Table - ‚Äúit‚Äôs not really a cooking show as it is about 50 top chiefs and how they got to be where they are now. I love that a lot of them  drew from their roots, went back to them and have found ways to bring them into the present... ‚Äú You might want to start with the episodes on Albert Adria and mashama bailey
